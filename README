This is an interface to the BCF2000, according to the patch included. Not smart, I know, but my first MIDI patch, and I don't want to start over again :P

So in the end, goal is for you to use one layers, one controls and 4 imgProc rather than have a full console. 
Abstractions:

click $CC $channel(on/off button)
fader $CC $channel (fader and knobs)

layer $layerID returns Opacity, Mute, Lock as a list
layers return 8 layers, each containing the forementionned list. input just bangs the whole thing.

controls has 4 outs: Go Pause Reset Back

imgProc $function returns each of it’s values. Crop has 4 valid entries, the 4 following are empty
	$function:
		Format = 4
		Image = 5
		Crop = 6
		Keys = 7
test has different test and monitoring functions
